# Chalcogenide-Perovskites-measuring-Bandgap-and-Efficiency-in-Solar-Cells
In this work, several machine learning algorithms—including CatBoost Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor, Support Vector Regression (SVR), and KNeighbors Regressor—were implemented to predict the bandgap and photovoltaic efficiency of CPs.
